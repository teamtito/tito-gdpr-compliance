# Tito GDPR Compliance

This repo services as a placeholder to track and manage Tito’s path to GDPR compliance.

We’re doing this as transparently as possible to give our customers some visibility on the steps we’re taking and have taken.

More can be found about our approach at the following blog post: [A Note on Security, Data Privacy and our Terms of Service](https://blog.tito.io/posts/a-note-on-security-data-privacy-and-our-terms-of-service)

We’re iterating here through the following policies:

- [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md)
- [Cookie Policy](./cookie-policy.md)
- [Data Retention Policy](./data-retention-policy.md)
- [Customer Personal Data](./customer-personal-data.md)
- [Third Parties](./third-parties.md)

If you have any questions or comments on any of this, please feel free to issue a pull request, raise an issue or let us know directly at [support@tito.io](mailto:support@tito.io).
